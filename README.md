## embix ksp crafts

My crafts for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/) should get versioned eventually. So this is what this repo is for.

If you want to browse the all the fancy craft files, use [kerbalx.com](http://kerbalx.com/embix/craft) instead. There are pictures like these:
